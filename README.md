## Introduction

In a highly competitive market, understanding sales performance is crucial for business growth and decision-making. Businesses often collect large volumes of sales data, but without effective analysis, the data becomes underutilized and decisions are made on assumptions rather than insights.

This project was developed to bridge that gap by offering a comprehensive sales performance analysis dashboard. It provides interactive visualizations and key performance metrics that help stakeholders understand trends, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions. This dashboard ensures that sales teams and management are aligned with performance goals and market dynamics.

## Key Metrics

This project highlights essential sales performance metrics, including:

- **Total Car Sales**: Overall revenue generated.
- **Sales by Branches**: Geographical distribution of sales.
- **Sales Trend**: Monthly analysis to track performance over time.
- **Top Performing Car Models and Brands**: Cars with the highest sales volume or revenue.
- **Customer Acquisition**: New vs returning customers.
- **Conversion Rate**: Ratio of leads to successful sales.

These metrics help in monitoring growth, assessing team performance, and forecasting future trends.
