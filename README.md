## Introduction

In a highly competitive market, understanding sales performance is crucial for business growth and decision-making. Businesses often collect large volumes of sales data, but without effective analysis, the data becomes underutilized and decisions are made on assumptions rather than insights.

This project was developed to bridge that gap by offering a comprehensive sales performance analysis dashboard. It provides interactive visualizations and key performance metrics that help stakeholders understand trends, identify bottlenecks, and make data-driven decisions. This dashboard ensures that sales teams and management are aligned with performance goals and market dynamics.

## Key Metrics

This project highlights essential sales performance metrics, including:

- **Total Car Sales**: Overall revenue generated.
- **Sales by Branches**: Geographical distribution of sales.
- **Sales Trend**: Monthly analysis to track performance over time.
- **Top Performing Car Models and Brands**: Cars with the highest sales volume or revenue.
- **Customer Acquisition**: New vs returning customers.
- **Conversion Rate**: Ratio of leads to successful sales.

These metrics help in monitoring growth, assessing team performance, and forecasting future trends.

## Summary

The 2020 Sales Performance Dashboard for AutoCar LTD reveals a strong sales year, totaling **1,491 vehicle units sold**. Key insights include:

- The majority of customers fall within the **26‚Äì35 age range**, reflecting a youthful market.
- **Lagos, Osun, and Ogun** branches performed exceptionally well, while **Ekiti, Ondo, and Oyo** underperformed relative to their population sizes.
- Sales peaked in **November** and were consistently strong on **Wednesdays**.
- **Ford** and **Toyota** models such as **Corolla, Fiesta, and Civic** were top performers, while **Chevrolet** and **Camry** lagged behind.

## Observations

### Branch Performance
- **Ekiti** contributed only **1.14%** of sales despite representing **7.56%** of the population.
- **Ondo and Oyo** also showed lower-than-expected performance.
- Meanwhile, **Osun and Ogun** exceeded expectations, with high sales figures despite moderate PAYE and population levels.

### Market Risks
- Closing branches in underperforming states may impact **overall market reach** and brand visibility.

### Expansion Opportunities
- States like **Osun and Ogun** demonstrate strong **sales-to-population efficiency**.
- Consider expansion into similar markets like **Edo** and **Kwara**, where purchasing power is strong despite mid-range population.l


## Recommendations

- **Do Not Rush to Close Branches**: Before closing low-performing branches like Ekiti, conduct a thorough **cost-per-sale analysis**.
- **Marketing Over Closure**: Increase **targeted marketing campaigns** in low PAYE states such as Oyo and Ondo to boost visibility and affordability.
- **Branch Expansion**: Explore new branch openings in states with high efficiency and potential (e.g., Edo, Kwara).
- **Inventory Optimization**:
  - Prioritize stocking high-demand models: **Corolla, Fiesta, Civic**.
  - Reduce inventory of underperforming models like **Camry**, unless supported by regional sales data.
- **Brand Strategy**: Strengthen dealership partnerships with top-performing brands **Toyota** and **Ford**.
- **Sales Strategy for Lagos**: Although Lagos has a large population and economy, sales underperformed. Adopt **premium marketing tactics** to better convert its high-income segment.
- **Financing Strategy**: Introduce or expand **vehicle financing options** in low-PAYE states to make car ownership more accessible.
